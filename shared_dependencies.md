1. Scrapy: All the files share the Scrapy framework as a dependency. Scrapy is used for creating spiders, defining items, handling requests and responses, and storing scraped data.

2. WikiSpider: The "wiki_spider.py" file defines a Scrapy Spider named "WikiSpider". This spider is used across the project to crawl and scrape data from Wiki.

3. AreaCodeItem: The "items.py" file defines a Scrapy Item named "AreaCodeItem". This item is used to structure the scraped data about area codes.

4. JSONExportPipeline: The "pipelines.py" file defines a Scrapy Pipeline named "JSONExportPipeline". This pipeline is used to process and store the scraped data in a JSON format.

5. Settings: The "settings.py" file defines various settings for the Scrapy project. These settings are used across the project to configure the behavior of Scrapy.

6. Middlewares: The "middlewares.py" file defines various Scrapy middlewares. These middlewares are used across the project to handle requests and responses.

7. run.py: This file is used to start the Scrapy spider. It shares the "WikiSpider" dependency with the "wiki_spider.py" file.

8. __init__.py: These files are used to mark directories on disk as Python package directories. They share the Scrapy dependency with all other files.

9. DOM Elements: The "wiki_spider.py" file will contain the names of the DOM elements to be scraped. These names are shared with the "items.py" and "pipelines.py" files, which use them to structure and store the scraped data.

10. Function Names: Functions defined in one file (like parse functions in "wiki_spider.py", process_item in "pipelines.py") may be called in other files, creating a shared dependency.
